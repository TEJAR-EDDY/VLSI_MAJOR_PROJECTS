# VLSI Major Projects in Verilog HDL üöÄ  

This repository contains my self-developed **VLSI major projects** implemented in **Verilog HDL**.  
I created these projects as part of my **advanced learning journey** to strengthen RTL design, verification, and on-chip communication protocol understanding.  

Each project includes Verilog design files, testbenches, and simulation support.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone this Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TEJAR-EDDY/VLSI_MAJOR_PROJECTS.git
   cd VLSI_MAJOR_PROJECTS


2. **Navigate to a specific project folder**

   ```bash
   cd ONCHIP_AMBA_PROTOCOLS/AHB
   ```

3. **Compile the design and testbench**

   ```bash
   iverilog -o sim_out design.v testbench.v
   ```

4. **Run the simulation**

   ```bash
   vvp sim_out
   ```

5. **View waveforms in GTKWave**

   ```bash
   gtkwave dump.vcd
   ```

## üåü About

This repository represents my **major-level VLSI projects**, developed independently to build **strong fundamentals in digital design, verification, and SoC protocols**.
It is a continuation of my earlier [Mini Projects Repository](https://github.com/TEJAR-EDDY/VLSI_MINI_PROJECTS), showcasing my step-by-step growth in VLSI design and verification.
