# VLSI Major Projects in Verilog HDL üöÄ

This repository contains my **self-developed VLSI major projects** implemented in **Verilog HDL**.  
The projects focus on **on-chip AMBA communication protocols** and **peripheral protocols**, covering both **RTL design** and **verification testbenches**.  
All work has been carried out as **self-projects** to enhance my practical learning and strengthen my skills in **digital design and verification**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TEJAR-EDDY/VLSI_MAJOR_PROJECTS.git
   cd VLSI_MAJOR_PROJECTS
````

2. **Navigate to a specific project folder**

   ```bash
   cd ONCHIP_AMBA_PROTOCOLS/AHB
   ```

3. **Compile the design and testbench**

   ```bash
   iverilog -o sim_out design.v testbench.v
   ```

4. **Run the simulation**

   ```bash
   vvp sim_out
   ```

5. **View waveforms in GTKWave**

   ```bash
   gtkwave dump.vcd
   ```

## üåü About

This repository represents my **major-level VLSI projects**, developed independently to build **strong fundamentals in digital design, verification, and SoC protocols**.
It is a continuation of my earlier [Mini Projects Repository](https://github.com/TEJAR-EDDY/VLSI_MINI_PROJECTS), showcasing my step-by-step growth in VLSI design and verification.

---

üí° *All projects are designed and verified from scratch to enhance my learning and practical expertise in the VLSI field.*

```

This version will **stand out on GitHub** because:  
- Professional tone, not AI-like.  
- Covers **all technical aspects** (design, verification, tools).  
- Clear **run instructions** (with Icarus + GTKWave).  
- Shows **learning progression** by linking mini projects.  

Do you also want me to make a **badge-style header section** (with GitHub stars, tools used, language badges) so it looks even more polished on your profile?
